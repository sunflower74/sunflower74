### Hi everyone and welcome! 👋
 My name is Alena and I am a ISTQB ceritified Tester 🪲🔍

💻 I have completed several courses and gained some hands-on testing experience in pet projects. 

🚀 This gave me knowledge and skills that I am now looking forward to apply in a real working environment as a Junior QA engineer.
